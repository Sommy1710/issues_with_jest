Each team will work on the aspect of the project assigned to them and will ensure that they follow best practices and maintain the highest standards in the development of this applcation. The team divisions will be shared in class and each team is to push their work to separate branches depending on what they are working on.

### Month One

#### Team One

Team one will be responsible for setting up the application and completing the user authentication and authorization module. Team one will also write unit tests associated with the module they have developed and these tests should be behaviour driven(BDD).

#### Team Two

Team two will be responsible for the CRUD operations associated with the books part of the application. This means that they will have to establish the relationship between the books and the authors. The team will also write tests associated with the module and each test must be behaviour driven(BDD)

#### Team Three

Team three will be responsible for the CRUD operations associated with the authors part of the application. This means that they will have to establish the relationship between the authors and the books. The team will aso write tests associated with the module and each test must be behaviour driven(BDD)

#### Team Four

Team four will wirte the API documentation for this application with Postman and will update this README document with the link to the document when they are done. They will also generate test coverage reports from the tests written by the other team members.
